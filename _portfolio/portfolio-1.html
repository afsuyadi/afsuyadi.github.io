A project that uses Machine Learning to forecast and optimize bioenergy crop's production in India. The project is divided into three section : <br/>
(a) The use of geographical location, rainfall and elevation data to find which feature is the most significant <br/>
(b) Training and validating data in order to find the most efficient model <br/>
(c) Forecasting and Optimizing the bioenergy crop using the most efficient model <br/>
