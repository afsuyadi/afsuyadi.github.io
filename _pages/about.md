I am a Research Engineer who is passionate in integrating Chemical Engineering with Data Science and Machine Learning to drive innovation in renewable energy, clean-fuel technology, photocatalysis, and biomass utilization. With a 6-year academic background (BSc & MSc) in Chemical Engineering and a 4-year of industry experience as a Software Engineer, I aim to bridge computational techniques with chemical processes to enhance efficiency and sustainability.

My research is deeply rooted in process optimization and AI-driven modeling for chemical and energy systems. My thesis was supervised by Dr. Dwiwahju Sasongko, an expert in coal and renewable energy processing, alongside Dr. Jenny Rizkiana and Dr. Winny Wulandari, whose guidance has shaped my expertise in sustainable technologies.
