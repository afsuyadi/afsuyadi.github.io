I am a Research Engineer who is passionate to integrate Chemical Engineering with Data Science and Machine Learning in order to drive innovation in renewable energy, clean-fuel technology, and process optimization. With a 6-year academic background (BSc & MSc) in Chemical Engineering and 4 years of industry experience as a Software Engineer, I strive to bridge computational techniques with chemical processes to enhance efficiency and sustainability.

My academic study focused on biomass utilization for clean fuel and renewable energy production, using these various pathways which produce :

✅ Pyrolysis             : Hybrid Coal, Biochar, Bio-oil

✅ Combustion            : Steam generation 

✅ Gasification          : Syngas

✅ Fermentation          : Bioethanol, Fermented solid waste, biomethane

✅ Transesterification   : Biodiesel

My academic research is deeply rooted in combustion, pyrolysis, biomass utilization, and photocatalysis. My Master's thesis was supervised by Dr. Dwiwahju Sasongko, an expert in coal and renewable energy processing, along with Dr. Jenny Rizkiana and Dr. Winny Wulandari, whose guidance helped refine my expertise in sustainable technologies. As a research assistant, I supervised undergraduate students in laboratory experiments, designed and built chemical reactors, and contributed to multiple faculty research projects.

In addition to my research experience, I have strong technical skills in programming and computational modeling, including:

✅ Process Computation & Simulation   : Matlab, FlexPDE, Aspen Hysys

✅ Web frameworks                     : Django, Odoo

✅ Databases                          : MySQL, PostgreSQL

✅ Data Science and Visualization     : Scikit-learn, Plotly, Matplotlib

✅ Artificial Intelligence            : TensorFlow, LangChain, OpenCV


By combining my expertise in chemical engineering and technical tools, I am committed to advancing AI-driven solutions for the energy sector.
